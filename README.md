Thanks for taking a look at the Group Management Application.

Objective: To be able to manage a club's membership

How it works:

A User can enter Club information and then the club will be listed in all of the drop down selectors on the site.
Then a user can enter a member name and other demographic information. Once that is done, a user can then control whether or not they are a pending, current or former member.
