 ******************README******************************

 This readme will currently be a blueprint of the final project until the project is complete.


 Flow:
 Homepage => Add a club =>
 Once a club is added, then users can be added. Potential members can be added as well and will be pending.
 Once their membership status has been reviewed, you can change their status to current.

 Upcoming additions to the project:
  - Integrate with an event planning app or google api for sending out invite requests and managing club events.
  - Club member demographics. How many people have twins vs triplets as well as other children. How many members live in various cities.
  - Mass communication - be able to send emails and texts all at once.
  - Login for added privacy and ensure only you can see personal info about your club.
